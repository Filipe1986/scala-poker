### Tie Break
High Card: Compare the highest card of each hand; if these are the same, compare the next highest, and so on, until a winner is found.

One Pair: Compare the pair first. If the pairs are the same, compare the kickers in descending order.

Two Pair: Compare the higher pair first, then the lower pair. If both pairs are the same, compare the kicker.

Three of a Kind: Compare the three cards that make the set. If these are the same, compare the kickers.

Straight: Compare the highest card of the straight. The player with the higher top card wins. In most games, an Ace can play both high (above a King) and low (below a 2) in a straight.

Flush: Compare the highest card first, then the second highest, and so on, until a winner is found.

Full House: Compare the three of a kind first. If these are the same, compare the pairs.

Four of a Kind: Compare the four cards of the same rank. If these are the same (possible in games with community cards), compare the kicker.

Straight Flush: Compare the highest card of the straight flush. The player with the higher top card wins.
